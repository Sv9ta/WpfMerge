1 Now that the winter's gone, the earth hath lost
2 Her snow-white robes, and now no more the frost
3 Candies the grass, or casts an icy cream
4 Upon the silver lake or crystal stream;
5 But the warm sun thaws the benumbed earth,
6 And makes it tender; gives a sacred birth
7 To the dead swallow; wakes in hollow tree
8 The drowsy cuckoo, and the humble-bee.
9 Now do a choir of chirping minstrels bring
10 In triumph to the world the youthful Spring.
11 The valleys, hills, and woods in rich array
12 Welcome the coming of the long'd-for May.
13 Now all things smile, only my love doth lour;
14 Nor hath the scalding noonday sun the power
15 To melt that marble ice, which still doth hold
16 Her heart congeal'd, and makes her pity cold.
17 The ox, which lately did for shelter fly
18 Into the stall, doth now securely lie
19 In open fields; and love no more is made
20 By the fireside, but in the cooler shade
21 Amyntas now doth with his Chloris sleep
22 Under a sycamore, and all things keep
23 Time with the season; only she doth carry
24 June in her eyes, in her heart January.
